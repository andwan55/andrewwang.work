                                <p>The Marvel Research Program (MRP) was newly founded and required a website to not only start building a web presence, but also 
                                    provide a hub for applicants and future students to refer to for crucial program information. It needed to provide a very 
                                    specific list of features: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>access to an <span class="text-bold">application form</span>,</li>

                                    </ul>

                                <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
                                <p>MRP at its core is designed to appeal to parents and students who seek more academic experience to bolster their chances of
                                    getting into desired colleges and their resume, both of which are very specific demographics. In order to design for them,
                                    it's critical to understand what they're looking for and are immediately drawn to on a website.<br>
                                    I drafted these personas after interviewing parents and students within the target range:<br><br>

                                    information, and the less steps possible to distract them the better. Ideally, the goal is to grab the viewer's interest upon 
                                    reaching the homepage and increasing <span class="text-bold">ease of access</span> for the other course information pages that

                                    As a new business, even with a concise definition of our target demographic, we would need an effective brand to stand out 
                                    from other academic programs (tutoring, SAT/ACT prep, other research programs). Some quick research yielded a few examples, 
                                    which I drew inspiration from for MRP's first logo designs.
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <p class="text-subtitle">Education-related logo examples</p>
                                <br>

                                <p>Initially, MRP's name was intended to be "Data Science Research Program" (DSRP), and was later adjusted to Marvel Research 
                                    Program to reflect a more unique branding. My friends and I wanted to retain the initial color choices, and I drafted the 
                                    second logo in the center below to evoke "star" imagery. After some more brainstorming and discussion, this was revised
                                    to incorporate the program name's initial "M" and "linked" imagery to indicate the interdisciplinary focus of the research
                                    we guide students in. I also ended up choosing a softer, rounder font in a more modern style to stand out more, as 
                                    many other education-related programs tend to use traditional fonts with sharper edges.
                                </p>

                                <p>Although my team and I hoped to keep the green color from the original logo, I also wanted to explore other palettes in case
                                    they would be more suited to the new design. I narrowed down color palette options to the ones below.
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <p>I drew up quick mockups of some ads in each palette to help with choosing, and opted for a simpler modern look. A common problem 
                                    I noticed in many existing academic organizations is a tendency to clutter promotional material and have unclear websites -
                                    the chosen style should minimize such issues. After surveying colleagues along with friends and family in the target audience,
                                    I ended up choosing the second palette with the original shade of green with a new complementary pink color, which received 
                                    the most positive responses.
                                </p>

                                    Most first-time visitors in surveys indicated that they would prefer to be able to quickly acquaint themselves with the website,
                                    rather than spend/waste time figuring out how to find what they're looking for. Many online sites and research also indicated that
                                    most business websites had some sort of <span class="text-bold">hero and/or intro on their homepage upon loading</span>, and a 
                                    call-to-action like "Schedule a Meeting" or "Click to Find Out More". I decided to place these items in those same positions
                                    on our homepage for the greatest ease of access.
                                </p>

                                    For this project, I designed the website with common features such as a <span class="text-bold">clear navigation menu</span> 
                                    at the top, and present the content of the page below. I also opted for <span class="text-bold">larger margins</span> on the sides to help draw the user's focus to relevant content, while also
                                    simultaneously avoiding overwhelming them with too much activity on the page. "Cards" were also used to 
                                    <span class="text-bold">group together</span> information, such as with a specific course's picture & details, to improve 
                                    clarity and ease of use (Gestalt laws).

                                    In order to introduce some level of design variation on the website's subpages, I also built collapsible buttons to avoid 
                                    overflowing a page with too much content. After preliminary user testing, the majority of feedback indicated that the longer the
                                    subpage lengths, the more potential losses in interest overall, even if they were initially interested in the value proposition.
                                    By providing the user with the option to only view what information they choose, it introduces a more 
                                    <span class="text-bold">intuitive experience when navigating the website.</span>

                                <p>
                                    Success Koach is a college counseling service provided by Harpal Kochar and his team of counselors, aimed at providing customized
                                    milestone plans for high school students to best improve their chances at getting in their desired colleges. After running the
                                    business using a more simplistic webpage, he felt it was time to upscale to a website with a more intuitive, streamlined, and 
                                    brand-forward design using the Kajabi platform. To accomplish these adjustment goals, the new version had to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>present a <span class="text-bold">memorable & appealing brand identity,</span></li>
                                        <li>concisely show <span class="text-bold">offered services</span> such as guidance plans + resources,</li>
                                        <li>and <span class="text-bold">enable easy access to engagement (meetings/calls)</span> in an unobtrusive manner.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <br><br>

                                <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Success Koach's unique point of appeal is that they offer guidance plans customized to each student's current grade level, 
                                    advising them on the best courses of action in regards to every aspect in high school and for college applications. Many 
                                    other counseling services are limited to essay editing and broad advice, instead of working with each student no matter the 
                                    level or background to help curate their profile (in addition to essays and advising). The parents that would be interested 
                                    in these services are part of a specific demographic, as I found through research described below:<br><br>
                                    <span class="text-bold">Persona & insights</span>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Parent (~40-55 years old) &#128107
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Looks for <span class="text-bold-alt">credibility</span>, proof of work</li>
                                                <li>Reads/skims over offered services</li>
                                                <li>Searches for contact info/method</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br>

                                    However, in this industry, many parents <span class="text-bold">do not have the time to search for a counseling service</span>
                                    manually. Most will look to their friends for recommendations, or look up local businesses that may be more familiar with the 
                                    nuances specific to their student's school. As a result, it is important to recognize as well as clearly present Success Koach's 
                                    branding around these needs.

                                    <span class="text-bold">Unique Value Proposition (UVP)</span><br>
                                    Unique value propositions (UVPs) are very effective in quickly and concisely communicating to a potential customer what the 
                                    <span class="text-bold">value of the business is, what it offers, and often what makes it stand out.</span> As such, I 
                                    handpicked what I felt were the most appealing characteristics of Success Koach's business model, and presented it like so 
                                    (using the design & palette described in the development process further below).
                                    <br>

                                    <br><br>

                                    Most prospective customers have varying attention spans, especially since they may have been looking for a while and should not
                                    have to spend additional time "solving" how an unfamiliar website works. I planned to address this note by placing a 
                                    <span class="text-bold">simple and clear hero</span> on the landing section of the homepage as well as an easily accessible
                                    <span class="text-bold">"Schedule Meeting" button</span> to immediately let visitors know how to get in touch with the business.
                                    Other significant points to present to customers include, in order of rough importance:

                                    Much of the content is consolidated into the homepage, as first-time visitors wondering whether the business is worth engaging
                                    with will not explore pages with more time-consuming content (i.e. blog & resource pages). The idea is to have potential 
                                    customers follow the below user journey:</p>

                                <p><span class="text-bold">Design & layout</span><br>
                                    Although Success Koach has been in operation for a couple of years already, the previous website was more utility-focused and
                                    placed less emphasis on more nuanced aspects such as aesthetics, brand identity, and UX. These were present, but needed to be 
                                    presented more clearly in the new version. Initial research that I conducted yielded that similar organizations often
                                    incorporated themes and symbols of education into their brand (Success Koach's name already did so as well). 
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <br>

                                <p>I wanted to use a similar approach to designing Success Koach's new logo, though there were important points that had to be
                                    accounted for:
                                    <br>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Simple (minimize clutter)</li>
                                        <li>Elegant</li>
                                        <li>Education-themed</li>
                                        <li>Memorable</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br>

                                    The development process for the logo went by relatively fast - I drafted a quick mockup which was approved, and finalized a
                                    colored version which we settled on. I chose to go for a navy blue palette for the logo and website as I felt it evoked a 
                                    more <span class="text-bold">"polished"</span> and <span class="text-bold">"academic"</span> identity for the business. This 
                                    style was later extended to the rest of the website's layout.

                                    Prior to implementation on the Kajabi platform, I composed simple mockups of what the homepage layout & styling could look like
                                    (at this point with the original logo). Although they accomplish much of what I initially planned, they had several outstanding
                                    problems which are noted below.

                                    While continuining to develop Success Koach's website, I made sure to account for the errors noted in the prior section. I 
                                    relocated and renamed the "Get Started" call-to-action to a 
                                    <span class="text-bold">more direct "Schedule a Meeting" button</span> in the center and top of the page - this eliminates
                                    the previous obscurity issue. I also revised the UVP to the finalized version, more accurately <span class="text-bold">

                                    </div>
                                    <p>The Cookbook App Concept (or on the report at the bottom, the "Kitchen Organizer App") is an idea that I developed during my 
                                        third year at SBU, since I was living on my own and had to manage my own cooking. This was mainly due to how inedible the food
                                        on campus was, and being forced on campus after COVID had settled down meant dealing with that again. As someone who values
                                        variety in their diet, I needed a way to explore different dishes from different cuisines as well as keep track of my
                                        current ingredient inventory easily and accurately. Although I did not work on the idea during that year, it laid the 
                                        groundwork for when I had the chance to next semester in my senior year, from my Interdisciplinary Senior Project course.
                                        I took the opportunity in that class to utilize the content and spend time on thinking through the app, which resulted
                                        in the work you see below.
                                    </p><br>

                                    <p>I wanted the app to seem user-friendly and intuitive to use, ideally something that a new user could begin taking advantage 
                                        within minutes of installing it. Thus, I chose a light green and blue palette, as I felt that would be the least jarring and 
                                        feel more organic. The logo below uses this combination and just has some simple chef's hat imagery as well as a bookmark to
                                        imply its purpose.

                                    <br><br>
    
                                    <p>Before composing the prototype wireframes for the app, I thought about the pain points the target audience would have, and 
                                        how the program's interface and purpose would satisfy those points. These features would become the goals of the app, listed
                                        here: to allow users to maximize use of their ingredients, keep track of what is in stock, compose and sort custom recipes, 
                                        generate automated recipe plans by day(s)/week based on inventory, and search for other recipes by other users. For a
                                        complete explanation of the app's functionalities, see the project report below.

                                    <p>Due to the fact that the problems I mention above are faced by many people, there are many other apps that are similar in
                                        varying degrees. Thus, I also conducted a competitor analysis to better identify where my idea could succeed and not simply
                                        join a saturated market (see report for complete comparisons). My takeaway from my research was that there were key features
                                        that had to be included in the final product, such as: recipe scanning, a self-learning search function, multi-platform access, 
                                        display of trending recipes, inventory management, and a smooth, modernized user interface.<br><br>

                                    <p>The ResDec App concept (short for Respiratory Condition Detection Application) was a project I designed and developed for my 
                                        Human-Computer Interaction class. We were tasked with coming up with an application concept that included some sort of
                                        statistical analysis that would be connected in some way to an interface made with the course's material in mind. This was my
                                        first time learning of and utilizing Figma as a design tool, and after getting to know the basics, I drew up the wireframes
                                        seen below. The frames are meant to represent the process of a user logging in and being able to submit chest X-ray scans
                                        as images for the app to process. For the statistical analysis component of the project, I created a machine learning model
                                        in Google Colab and coded using Python which was trained on chest scan images pulled from the online Kaggle database. I then
                                        organized my findings in a Jupyter notebook to show the efficacy of the model, which is also available below in the Github 
                                        link. The Figma design file with the complete wireframes is accessible below through the link as well.

                                <p>I was tasked by Dolly Harish of Worryfree Legal Documents to redesign the website for her legal

                                    previous website was on, to revamp her page. See below for some website screenshots and also the website link.

                                <p>For my Introductory Interdisciplinary Project course, I worked with a team to design, program, test, and present a gesture 
                                    recognition device using Arduino and a machine learning model. The device, in the rough shape of a short wand, was capable of
                                    recognizing motions drawn with it such as loops, arcs, and lines. Below is the Github repository for the project.

                                <p>I and a friend of mine, Chiron Tran, helped a mutual friend Matthew Cho with recycling an old Santa Claus drummer toy into a 
                                    new version of it that would be capable of moving to the beat of a preuploaded song, which would play when turned on. I programmed
                                    an Arduino Uno using the Minim libaries and the Processing IDE for the toy, allowing it the move in sync with a song and flash
                                    lights on beat as well. Below is the Github repository for the toy and the Youtube video Matthew shot and edited of us working
                                    on the project.
