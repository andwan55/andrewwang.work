                                I take commissions for student portfolio sites! This service is something I offer to help students curate, craft, and build their 
                                personal portfolio and presenting it on a custom website. As of right now, there is a significant need when applying to colleges 
                                for personalized, impressive websites for students to showcase their achievements, talents, and academic endeavors. By packaging
                                all of their accomplishments and skills in concise and visually attractive pages, it shows thoughtfulness as well as professionalism
                                for someone at that stage of their academic career.<br><br>
                                My past works also include business websites offering a service of some kind, 
                                and this very website - please see my <a href="/work">work showcases</a> for a comprehensive view. If you are interested, please 
                                read my terms of service below and let me know at <a href="mailto: andwan55@gmail.com">andwan55@gmail.com</a>, or schedule a meeting

                            <p>
                                I reserve the right to refuse or halt any commission at any point.
                                <br><br>
                                All projects go through a standard process: both parties will discuss and agree to the project details & requirements listed in a 
                                statement of work (SoW), which will then be formally drawn up in a contract to be signed and returned to me.
                                <br><br>
                                All projects will start at a base cost of $990. The cost may increase proportionate to the complexity/difficulty of the project. 
                                The cost MUST be paid upfront upon signing of the contract before work will begin. 
                                <br><br>
                                The client may choose the amount of pages for the website from a range of 1 to 3, as well as from a selection of template designs 
                                provided upon request. Adjustments to said template are assumed but not required. Special requests for an alternate design and/or 
                                more pages will be considered and priced on a case by case basis. 
                                <br><br>
                                Any additional requests by the client for edits, items to be made, etc. of any kind that are not agreed upon in the original contract
                                will be subject to additional fees. I reserve the right to determine the fee amount as well as refuse the request, and upon agreement 
                                the fee is due immediately.
                                <br><br>
                                Payment is made through Paypal and paid in full upfront at the designated stages of the project. Alternative payment is available 
                                through Zelle if requested.
                                <br><br>
                                For all website development projects, the client party can request it either be made through a specified platform or developed from 
                                scratch. Please note that unless otherwise agreed upon, sites developed from scratch will be hosted through Github Pages using the
                                client's own Github account.
                                <br><br>
                                For the duration of the project, the client may request one video call meeting (i.e. over Zoom) for an hour maximum per week, free of 
                                charge. Any extra meetings within the same week will be charged at $50/hr. I reserve the right to determine meeting availabilities.
                                <br><br>
                                WHAT YOU RECEIVE: a high quality, complete, and customized website designed for your specified purpose.
                                <br><br>
                                USAGE POLICY: I do not consent to any of the files (.html, .js, images, etc.) involved in the project being distributed to anyone 
                                other than the designated client party. They are also not permitted for commercial use, or any other unless otherwise discussed.
                                I reserve the right to display the project in my portfolio as my work.

                                    I consult with a client first through a meeting to determine what elements & items need to go into a statement of work, which
                                    is then adjusted until agreed upon and formally written as a contract to be signed. After fees are paid, I then create an 
                                    initial proposal and process the client's information (such as extracurriculars, course history, internships, etc.) before
                                    returning wireframe(s) to be approved. Once approval is given, I begin implementing the proposal and generate any necessary 
                                    assets as well (graphics, logos, etc.). Development continues until all criteria is met, and I hand the final product off to
                                    you.<br><br>
                                    TLDR: statement of work + contract >> proposal + wireframes >> implementation >> final product

                                    All projects have a base cost of $990. Any increase in cost of the project will vary
                                    based on the amount of work needed to complete the website, determined in a consultation meeting.

                                <p>
                                    Some platforms or existing frameworks that I'm willing to work with, but not limited to, include Wordpress, Weebly, Kajabi, 
                                    and Google Sites. If a website is made from scratch (raw HTML/CSS/JS files), then I usually host the site using Github Pages.

                                    There is a large range of what you may request to be made for your portfolio website. Clients in the past have asked for new
                                    logos (for their brand identity), graphics (i.e. promotional ads, infographics, and diagrams), and general website assets 
                                    (i.e. background images). Other common options include pages, subsections, and compositions (i.e. description text).

                                <br><br>

                                <p>
                                    Items and parts of a project are usually remade until they are to the client's satisfaction. However, if I deem that the client
                                    is making excessive requests for a given item to be changed, I may refuse the request.
                                </p>

                                <br><br>

                                    Project times will vary depending on the complexity of the work - a website being designed from scratch will naturally take 
                                    longer, of course. In general though, you can expect the development process to take approximately 4-6 weeks to complete.

                                    For the duration of the project, the client may request up to one meeting per week for an hour maximum, free of charge. These
                                    meetings are to go over milestones of the project, and the limit is to prevent redundancies. If the client feels more meetings
                                    are necessary in a given week, they may pay for more at my standard rate of $50/hr.

                                    platforms such as Wordpress or Weebly tend to sacrifice customizability for ease of use. Therefore, there is a limit to my
                                    creative freedom if those are used to host the website.
                                </p>

                            <button class="collapsible">What if I realize I need something made or changed after the project has already started?</button>
                            <div class="collapsible-content">
                                <br>

                                    Since that would mean that this addition or adjustment does not fall under any of the items in the contract, there would be
                                    additional fees to have the work done. Here are examples of what would and would not require more costs:<br><br>
                                    Asking for another infographic to be made, or another page to be added on the website (YES)<br><br>
                                    Asking to edit an infographic to have a different color, or somewhat different layout/spacing (NO)<br><br>
                                    All items listed in the agreed contract are packaged within the cost at that stage. If an item is not made to satisfaction, 
                                    work will be done until it fulfills the client's criteria at no extra charge.

                            </div>

                            <br>

                            <button class="collapsible">Is there a large difference between a website made through a website editor and one made from scratch?</button>
                            <div class="collapsible-content">
                                <br>

                                <p>
                                    There is not necessarily a large difference between the final product of either choice. However, one made from scratch does offer
                                    complete control over the visual aspect of the website. If this is a high priority for you, please keep that in mind.

                                    I will provide the raw files (.jpeg, .html, .svg, etc.) used for a project upon request for your own personal use ONLY. Please
